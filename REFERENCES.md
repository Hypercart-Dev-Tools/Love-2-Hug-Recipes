The resources below informed the design principles codified in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). Each article covers one or more of the foundational concepts — SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI — that the checklist-driven architecture translates into concrete, enforceable rules for a Lovable/React/Supabase stack.

These are not required reading to use the system. They exist for developers who want to understand *why* the AGENTS.md rules exist, trace a specific guideline back to its source principle, or go deeper on a concept when onboarding new contributors.

If you add a new architectural rule to AGENTS.md that draws on an external source, add the reference here with a short summary of what it covers and how it connects to the project.

This Medium article by HlfDev offers a beginner-friendly overview of key software engineering principles including KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and SOLID.  It uses straightforward explanations and code examples, such as contrasting repeated tax calculation functions with a single unified one to illustrate DRY benefits.  The piece also briefly covers SOLID's five tenets and the "Tell, Don't Ask" principle, emphasizing adaptability over rigid rules for sustainable code.

InRhythm's comprehensive guide dives deeply into SOLID principles with practical code examples in an unspecified OOP language, starting from SRP using a refactored Report class separated from file-saving duties.  It covers OCP via extensible shape calculators, LSP with bird subclass pitfalls like Penguin, ISP through targeted interfaces, and DIP with decoupled switches and bulbs.  The article stresses SOLID's role in creating modular, extensible codebases for better long-term quality.

DigitalOcean's conceptual article explains SOLID using PHP examples, like an AreaCalculator evolving through SRP by delegating area logic to shapes and separating output formatting.  It demonstrates OCP and LSP with interfaces for extensibility and substitutability, ISP via split 2D/3D shape interfaces, and DIP through abstracted DB connections like PasswordReminder.  The tutorial highlights SOLID's benefits for maintainable, testable OOP systems adaptable to growth.

LeadDev's guide targets engineering leaders, framing SOLID as tools for scalable, team-friendly architecture beyond code, with SRP applied to avoid "God classes" in user systems or CI/CD.  It illustrates OCP in payment extensibility, LSP via predictable bird hierarchies, ISP with focused vehicle interfaces, and DIP for decoupled logging.  The piece addresses implementation challenges like overengineering and legacy refactoring, advocating workshops and incremental Boy Scout Rule changes.

IdataMax's blog expands beyond SOLID to include DRY, KISS, YAGNI, and GRASP patterns, positioning them as defenses against aging systems' complexity.  It details SOLID with Python refactors like SRP in reports, OCP notifiers, LSP storages, ISP printers, and DIP apps; DRY via centralized discounts; KISS by simplifying calculators.  GRASP patterns like Information Expert and Creator guide responsibility assignment for clear, evolvable designs.
